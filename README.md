# minesweeper
##### A project for CSC499 ADV. ANALYSIS OF AI

## Goal:
To write, compare, and analyze three different approaches to create a solver for the classic computer game Minesweeper

## Task List:
- [x] Create the game
  - [ ] Optional: make it a little prettier
- [x] Brute force solver
- [ ] Neural network
- [ ] Third algorithm (random forest?)
- [ ] Compare in terms of:
  - [ ] Winrate
  - [ ] Average solve time
  - [ ] Scalability
  - [ ] Types of mistakes
